        <span>Day 3: Kruger 4x4 Game Drive Full Day (Scheduled)</span>
        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Full day 4x4 game drive in the Kruger Park. Your scheduled departure will leave from your hotel at dawn as you set out in an open 4x4 safari vehicle for a short drive to one of the park's gates and into the Kruger National Park. It is one of the largest game reserves in Africa, stretching across a vast 18 989 square kilometres in the provinces of Limpopo and Mpumalanga. With over 12 000 elephants, 27 000 African buffalo and 1 000 leopards, the Big Five is well represented. White rhino sightings are frequent, while spotting a black rhino may require some patience and a bit of luck. Lions are plentiful with over 2 000 stalking the plains. Overall, the Kruger supports 147 free roaming mammal species. Of the 517 species of birds here, 253 are resident and the reserve supports six diverse eco-systems. Your morning safari concludes at one of the rest camps inside the reserve giving you the opportunity to stretch and refresh. The 4x4 vehicle will allow you to get very close to the surrounding vegetation while your experienced ranger follows fresh animal spoor. Your safari concludes in the late afternoon before returning to the hotel.

        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Pick up from your hotel for a full day Cape Winelands tour. Learn everything there is to know about wines, from the vineyard to the bottle. The Cape Wine Route is defined by the triangle that forms the towns of Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek. Stellenbosch is a charming old town with oak-shaded avenues and historical buildings. Franschhoek owes its name to the French Huguenots, who came to settle there in 1685 and planted the first quality vineyards, while Paarl has been a centre for the Afrikaner culture since the 19th century. Along the Route, wine estates welcome you to taste wines and cheeses and invite you to learn how the wines are made before you are returned to your hotel at the end of the tour</p>

        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Prepare for a glorious day out on the Cape Peninsula. You will be collected from your hotel for this full day Cape Peninsula tour to discover both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coastlines. The first stop is at the charming fishing village of Hout Bay, located in a beautiful valley on the Atlantic seaboard before continuing along the Atlantic coastline to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve and Cape Point – the most south-westerly tip of Africa and the mythical meeting place of two great oceans, flanked by striking seaside cliffs and blanketed in rich indigenous plant life. On the return trip, pass through the naval base of Simon's Town, and then traverse the fishing port of Kalk Bay and the lush suburb of Constantia. The day will end with a visit to the renowned Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens before returning to your hotel.</p>

        <span>Day 10: Cape Town</span>
        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Climb aboard a hydrofoil and look for marine life in the ecosystem of Table Bay on a 2-hour eco tour from Cape Town. See species in their natural surroundings, such as humpback and southern right whales, depending on the season.Get the chance to watch pods of dolphins breaching close to the boat and marvel at their acrobatic displays. Be enchanted by Cape fur seals lounging on the jetties and get close to unusual species, such as sunfish. Watch African penguins diving for fish to take back to their breeding colony on Robben Island. Encounter birdlife, such as terns, gannets, cormorants and mighty black-browed albatross.</p>
        <p>Marvel at the views of Cape Town from the aerial cableway and plateau on Table Mountain. The Mother City is synonymous with the striking mountain that is flanked by Devil’s Peak to the east and Lion’s Head to the west, providing a dramatic backdrop to the city. Table Mountain holds an unusually rich biodiversity and forms part of the Cape Floral Region, a protected area. Rock hyrax, or dassie as they are locally known, are often seen scampering through the scrub and the views from the summit over Table Bay, Robben Island and the Atlantic seaboard are breathtaking. The cable cars depart every 10 to 15 minutes and rotate 360 degrees as they travel up to 302 metres above sea level, giving passengers panoramic views over the city. Five minutes is all it takes to reach the summit and once there you can marvel at the views, have a bite to eat in the restaurant or do a bit of shopping at the extensive curio shop. The cableway only operates when weather permits.</p>

        <span>Day 11: Cape Town-Cape Town airport</span>
        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Pick up from your hotel for a half day Cape Town city tour. Be captivated by the multiethnic character and historical wealth of the Mother City. Cape Town is a rare cultural gem, resulting from the amalgamation of different nationalities and indigenous tribes. Alongside high-rise office blocks, a harmonious blend of architectural styles has been meticulously preserved, including Edwardian, Victorian and Cape Dutch. Narrow, cobblestone streets and the Islamic character of the Bo-Kaap enhance the cosmopolitan ambiance. The itinerary takes you to the City Hall, the Castle of Good Hope – this pentagon-shaped fort is the oldest surviving building in South Africa; the Company's Garden – a large public park, originally Jan van Riebeeck's vegetable garden, which he grew to feed the original colony as early as 1652; and Signal Hill with spectacular panoramas over the city, before returning to your hotel.</p>

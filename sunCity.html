        <p>Afternoon 4×4 game drive in the Pilanesberg National Park. Situated in the North West Province and just a stone's throw away from the popular Sun City, this dramatic stretch of land provides the perfect opportunity to view most of South Africa's wildlife. The park is distinctive in that it exists in a transition zone between two highly different climatic regions - the dry Kalahari and the wet Lowveld. These unique conditions in turn support a unique diversity of animal and plant life and bring together species that are not usually found together. Keep your eyes peeled for the Big Five as well as other rare species such as the cheetah and wild dog. As the heat of the day begins to fade, your chances of encountering predators also increases</p>

        <span>Day 3: Pilanesberg (2 km)</span>
        <p>Morning 4×4 game drive in the Pilanesberg National Park, one of the most popular accessible parks in South Africa. The landscape here reflects an ancient time with evidence of volcanic eruptions that occurred over 1 000 million years ago and intriguing Stone Age and Iron Age geological sites. Birdlife is prolific and the park supports over 350 different species. Keep your eyes peeled as you set off in the fresh dawn air towards Mamkwe Dam for species such as the kingfisher, fish eagle and cormorant. The dam is the largest body of water in the reserve, providing the perfect location to spot a wide variety of animals such as water buck, zebra and impala. Of course the Big Five is also on offer and the rich ecological diversity of the park makes these famous animals relatively easy to find.</p>

        <span>Day 5: Sun City-Lost City</span>
        <p>Breakfast.</p>
        <p>Lose yourself at the Lost City. This extraordinary aquatic theme park is located at the Sun City Resort Complex and is home to a maze of ruins and forests, cascades and mysteries. Conjured out of African myth, the area is a fantasy world of jungle, cliff-tumbling gardens, sparkling streams, waterfalls, swimming pools and al fresco dining areas, all designed to unleash your inner adventurous instinct. The Lost City boasts gorgeous verdant gardens that have been given botanical status as well as the Maze of the Lost City, the largest permanent maze in the Southern Hemisphere. It is made from stone and wood and creates the illusion of an ancient archaeological discovery, and is accessed by a 100 metre suspension bridge that begins in the Entertainment Centre where gaming, restaurants, cinemas and retail outlets are to be found.</p>

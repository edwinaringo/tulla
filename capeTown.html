        <span>Day 2: Scheduled Tour: Cape Town City Tour HD • Table Mountain Aerial Cableway </span>
        <p>Breakfast.</p>
        <p>Pick up from your hotel for a half day Cape Town city tour. Be captivated by the multiethnic character and historical wealth of the Mother City. Cape Town is a rare cultural gem, resulting from the amalgamation of different nationalities and indigenous tribes. Alongside high-rise office blocks, a harmonious blend of architectural styles has been meticulously preserved, including Edwardian, Victorian and Cape Dutch. Narrow, cobblestone streets and the Islamic character of the Bo-Kaap enhance the cosmopolitan ambiance. The itinerary takes you to the City Hall, the Castle of Good Hope – this pentagon-shaped fort is the oldest surviving building in South Africa; the Company's Garden – a large public park, originally Jan van Riebeeck's vegetable garden, which he grew to feed the original colony as early as 1652; and Signal Hill with spectacular panoramas over the city, before returning to your hotel.</p>
        <p>Marvel at the views of Cape Town from the aerial cableway and plateau on Table Mountain. The Mother City is synonymous with the striking mountain that is flanked by Devil’s Peak to the east and Lion’s Head to the west, providing a dramatic backdrop to the city. Table Mountain holds an unusually rich biodiversity and forms part of the Cape Floral Region, a protected area. Rock hyrax, or dassie as they are locally known, are often seen scampering through the scrub and the views from the summit over Table Bay, Robben Island and the Atlantic seaboard are breathtaking. The cable cars depart every 10 to 15 minutes and rotate 360 degrees as they travel up to 302 metres above sea level, giving passengers panoramic views over the city. Five minutes is all it takes to reach the summit and once there you can marvel at the views, have a bite to eat in the restaurant or do a bit of shopping at the extensive curio shop. The cableway only operates when weather permits</p>

        <span>Day 3: Scheduled Tour: Cape Peninsula FD incl. Penguins</span>
        <p>Breakfast.</p>
        <p>Prepare for a glorious day out on the Cape Peninsula. You will be collected from your hotel for this full day Cape Peninsula tour to discover both the Atlantic and Indian Ocean coastlines. The first stop is at the charming fishing village of Hout Bay, located in a beautiful valley on the Atlantic seaboard before continuing along the Atlantic coastline to the Cape of Good Hope Nature Reserve and Cape Point – the most south-westerly tip of Africa and the mythical meeting place of two great oceans, flanked by striking seaside cliffs and blanketed in rich indigenous plant life. On the return trip, pass through the naval base of Simon's Town, and then traverse the fishing port of Kalk Bay and the lush suburb of Constantia. The day will end with a visit to the renowned Kirstenbosch Botanical Gardens before returning to your hotel.</p>

        <span>Day 4: Scheduled Tour: Cape Winelands FD</span>
        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Pick up from your hotel for a full day Cape Winelands tour. Learn everything there is to know about wines, from the vineyard to the bottle. The Cape Wine Route is defined by the triangle that forms the towns of Stellenbosch, Paarl and Franschhoek. Stellenbosch is a charming old town with oak-shaded avenues and historical buildings. Franschhoek owes its name to the French Huguenots, who came to settle there in 1685 and planted the first quality vineyards, while Paarl has been a centre for the Afrikaner culture since the 19th century. Along the Route, wine estates welcome you to taste wines and cheeses and invite you to learn how the wines are made before you are returned to your hotel at the end of the tour</p>

        <span>Day 5: Marine Eco Tour (2 hours) • Victoria and Alfred Waterfront</span>
        <p>Breakfast</p>
        <p>Climb aboard a hydrofoil and look for marine life in the ecosystem of Table Bay on a 2-hour eco tour from Cape Town. See species in their natural surroundings, such as humpback and southern right whales, depending on the season.Get the chance to watch pods of dolphins breaching close to the boat and marvel at their acrobatic displays. Be enchanted by Cape fur seals lounging on the jetties and get close to unusual species, such as sunfish. Watch African penguins diving for fish to take back to their breeding colony on Robben Island. Encounter birdlife, such as terns, gannets, cormorants and mighty black-browed albatross.</p>
        <p>Explore the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront, situated at South Africa’s oldest working harbour in the centre of Cape Town. Offering over 450 retail outlets selling everything from high-end fashion and jewellery to food and crafts, the Victoria and Alfred Waterfront is one of Cape Town’s most popular destinations, attracting in excess of 23 million visitors a year. Besides offering vibrant and chic indoor and outdoor shopping and restaurants, you can also watch fishing boats dock with fresh fish or see a container ship being towed into the harbour by a tug boat. Draw-bridges over the water open and close every so often to allow smaller sailing vessels access to the docks, while the Cape Wheel gives unsurpassed 360 degree views of the city, and the outdoor amphitheatre plays host to music, dance and theatrical performances throughout the year.</p>

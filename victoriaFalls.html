        <span>Day 4</span>
        <p>The day is at leisure to enjoy the game viewing activities on offer. The game viewing opportunities around Sanctuary Chief's Camp are awe-inspiring. Elephant, wild dog, cheetah and leopard can all be spotted close to camp and the area also boasts over 500 species of bird. Mokoros, local dugout canoes, are ideal for getting close to the bush in the company of a highly trained local guide.</p>
        <p>Each June the whole area around the camp floods and turns the Okavango Delta into a labyrinth of lily-filled lagoons and streams where hippos fight for bathing rights and crocodiles wait for unwary antelope to linger too long over a drink. Poling through the byways created by the floodwaters is a magical experience that allows guests to get very close to the biggest of game and to see the world from a totally different angle - looking up onto the banks rather than down onto them.</p>

        <span>DAYS 1-4: SINGITA PAMUSHANA LODGE, MALILANGWE WILDLIFE RESERVE: 3 nights at Singita Pamushana Lodge in a suite on a full board basis</span>
        <p>Perched high on a sandstone ridge and overlooking the shimmering expanse of Malilangwe Dam, Singita Pamushana Lodge’s eight elegant suites – each with its own private plunge pool – draw inspiration from the rich tribal history of ancient Zimbabwe.</p>
        <p>Maximising opportunities to be immersed in the restorative power of its incredible wilderness setting, Pamushana’s guest experience allows for a safari that’s both soothing and inspiring – with comfort, intuitive ease and a complete sense of freedom underpinning every stay.
            </p>
        <p>The lodge – as well as a private-use villa, Malilangwe House – are set in the 130,000-acre Malilangwe Wildlife Reserve in Zimbabwe’s remote southeast, and guests have exclusive access to this untouched
            wilderness. Here they can immerse themselves in nature on twice-daily game drives, bush walks,
            sundowner boat cruises, excursions to rock art sites and more.</p>
        <p>Surrounded by captivating views and featuring a series of staggered and interlinked platforms, the main lodge area provides a variety of living spaces from which to appreciate the breathtaking natural beauty of the area. Expansive decks deepen connections with the landscape and a clifftop fire-pit and bar-deli overlooking the dam provides the perfect setting for alfresco dining and fireside storytelling.

            </p>

        <span>DAYS 4 – 7: TEMBO PLAINS CAMP, SAPI PRIVATE RESERVE, MANA POOLS REGION: 3 nights at Tembo Plains Camp in a luxury tent on a full board basis.</span>
        <p>Tembo Plains Camp is tucked away into a thick riverine forest on the edge of the Zambezi River, in the
            private 128,000-hectare Sapi Private Reserve, east of Zimbabwe’s Mana Pools National Park.
        </p>
        <p>Tembo Plains Camp has four double or twin bed configuration suites. Each has its own private indoor
            lounge area, outdoor swimming pool (with exercise bikes on an expansive veranda) and outdoor dining area. Stunning, handmade bathtubs with indoor and outside showers give the suite a sense of ‘home’ where you can move in and live. The Wi-Fi and working areas also provide space for you to catch up on business or manage your images from the day’s adventures. Each suite comes complete with a professional camera and lenses. High-quality binoculars are also available for guests to use whilst they are with us in the Sapi Reserve. All these little touches deliver the luxury Zimbabwe safari.
            </p>
        <p>The beautiful 2-bedroomed Tembo Suite comprises two suites flanking a shared lounge, dining area
            and pool. The Tembo Plains Suite is ideal for two couples or families travelling together and those
            guests looking for the ultimate private safari
            </p>

        <p>In the central area, the wine cellar and interactive 5-star kitchen feature this stone design again. The
            spa and curio store are each individually hidden discreetly behind beautifully weathered Zanzibar doors.
            </p>
        <p>Painted dogs (wild dogs), lions and leopards are common around Tembo Plains, whilst buffalo are
            regularly seen up and down, and sometimes swimming the Zambezi River itself, as are elephants.
            </p>
        <p>The private Sapi Reserve, a previous hunting area, was established in 2016 by Great Plains Conservation as a beautiful private photographic reserve safe for wildlife. It borders the Mana Pools National Park to the west and forms part of our mission to convert vast tracts of Africa into pure conservation land. It is now recognised as one of the finest wildlife destinations in Africa today. We access this fantastic wildlife sanctuary and the Mana Pools National Park if we want to offer a combined range of over 337,000 hectares of prime, protected wilderness for our guests. It is a part of the UNESCO World Heritage Site and a core area of the middle-Zambezi biosphere reserve.</p>
        <p>Enjoy the privacy of a safari, so rare today, in a wildlife-rich sanctuary along the Zambezi River with us.
            Here you don’t have to worry about anything else except how best to soak up every moment. Your
            safari with us includes everything, day and night wildlife-viewing drives, boating, canoeing or guided
            walks and tracking, drinks. And, of course, our Relais & Châteaux level cuisine and service.

        <span>DAYS 7 – 10: MPALA JENA CAMP, VICTORIA FALLS: 2 nights at Mpala Jena Camp in a luxury tent on a full board basis</span>
        <p>The area under conservation within the Zambezi National Park is 56,000 hectares (138,000 acres) and
            has a healthy and ever-increasing number of wildlife species, with higher concentrations of buffalo and
            elephants from June through to October. It has become an absolute gem of a reserve with some of the
            highest lions per square km concentrations than any other Zimbabwean park. The river is a magnet for
            wildlife and ensures consistent sightings of massive crocodiles and hippos who make their presence
            seen and heard throughout the day and night.
            </p>
        <p>This area is perfect for bird watching throughout the year, but with a higher diversity of species from
            November through April.
            </p>
        <p>Mpala Jena is by design sensitive to the environment of the Zambezi National Park. This is achieved by
            using canvas and local thatch in its construction and ensuring all the camp’s electricity needs come
            from its solar farm
            </p>
        <p>The architect team of Craig Hayman and Hannah Charlton and interior designer Tracy Kelly have
            created a haven that epitomizes “Barefoot Luxury” at its best. Mpala Jena is located on the white sandy edges of Zimbabwe’s Zambezi River and in the Zambezi National Park. The team sought to combine natural elements using thatched roofs in the main areas and flowing canvas luxury tents for the bedrooms. The sand floor in the bar area, and adjacent swimming pool, set the scene for guests to kick their shoes off and relax after their morning game drive or river cruise. The pool lounge makes you feel that you are right on the river. It is the ideal place to hang out with a book during the heat of the day. Mpala Jena is highly sought after for those wanting Victoria Falls accommodation.
            </p>

        <p>‘Mpala Jena’ means “White Impala”. According to the local National Park rangers, in 1979, albino impala sightings were reported when the Zambezi National Park was separated from the Victoria Falls National Park and declared a National Park.</p>
        <p>We have a variety of authentic camps and mobile experiences in Botswana and
            Zimbabwe. We would be happy to facilitate and plan any extended stay you might require in Southern
            and East Africa.
            </p>

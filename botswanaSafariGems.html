        <span>DAYS 1-3: ZARAFA CAMP, SELINDA RESERVE: THE SELINA RESERVE</span>
        <p>The Selinda Reserve is a 130,000-hectare private concession in northern Botswana at the crossroads
            of some of northern Botswana’s most prolific wildlife areas; upstream from Savute Channel and Chobe
            National Park and north of the expanding reaches of the greater Okavango Delta. This unique position
            gives it the advantages of both of these famous areas but with the tremendous advantage of exclusivity.
            It is a truly spectacular and varied landscape that boasts staggering wildlife populations in diverse
            habitats year-round.</p>
        <p>Home to some of the classic species, such as leopard, lion, elephant, buffalo, red lechwe, zebra and giraffe, it is also a refuge for some of the more uncommon species such as African wild dog, cheetah, roan and sable antelopes. And for birders, it will not disappoint. The African skimmer colony is a highlight, as are the antics of the black egret on the shores of Zibadianja Lagoon. From camp, hippos are visible in the lagoon and elephant wander through regularly.</p>

        <span>ZARAFA CAMP: 2 nights at Zarafa Camp in a luxury suite on a full board basis.</span>
        <p>Zarafa Camp is an intimate, four room exquisite tented camp located on the Selinda Reserve in northern Botswana, an area linking the Okavango Delta and the Chobe/Savute corridors. Its villa, the Dhow Suites, consist of two suites and private main area and operates entirely independently of main camp. Few camps rival the location of this little gem, which, together with Duba Plains Camp and Selinda Camp, is one of only three Relais & Châteaux properties in Botswana. Overlooking the crystal waters Zibadianja Lagoon, the source of the famous Savute Channel, every area of camp has a magnificent view. The lagoon is also the water source for a tremendous population of wildlife – dry season sightings boast buffalo and elephant by the hundreds.</p>
        <p>Zarafa Camp and Dhow Suites are the brainchild of the founders of Great Plains Conservation, who pooled their collective experience on safari to create what they deemed to be the best and most environmentally innovative camp. As a consequence, Zarafa may in fact be the “greenest” luxury safari camp on the continent. Only recycled hardwoods and canvas were used in the construction and all the camp’s electricity comes from its solar farm while a ‘bio-gas’ system recycles vegetable waste into usable cooking gas.</p>
        <p>The Zarafa Camp guest suites, 1000 sq. ft in size are under beige, flowing canvas, with canopy ceilings and completely open (yet netted) sides. Entering through the heavy wood Lamu door transports guests to a lavish space of deep reds, browns, brass and copper, evoking richness and beauty. Each suite has a full lounge and a gas fireplace. The large bedroom is connected to an open layout bathroom with impressive copper claw foot bath, indoor shower, separate loo and double basins.</p>
        <p>Decking around the suite leads to the private plunge pool and outdoor shower, all with views of pristine Botswana wilderness. Under an impressive canopy of African ebony trees, the camp has a sizable main lounge, with adjacent library and dining area. Zarafa has succeeded in successfully in retaining a clearly African feel, while balancing that delicate relationship between personal and informal and romance and adventure. With a maximum of just eight guests, Zarafa Camp offers complete flexibility. While drives do focus on the most comfortable and productive times of day, early morning and late afternoon, full day drives, walks and boating (water level dependent) are great ways to fill the day at Zarafa.</p>

        <span>DAYS 3–5: DUBA PLAINS CAMP, THE OKAVANGO DELTA: THE OKAVANGO DELTA</span>
        <p>The placid waters and lush indigenous forests offer a safe haven for innumerable bird and wildlife species. The renowned Duba Plains Camp sits in the heart of classic Okavango Delta habitat. A matrix of palm dotted islands, flood plains and woodland, the 77,000 hectare private concession typifies the region’s unique landscape. Many consider Duba Plains to be the Okavango’s Maasai Mara because of the sheer volume of wildlife.</p>
        <p>Duba Plains prides itself on its extraordinary wildlife experiences with reliable sightings of lion, buffalo, red lechwe, blue wildebeest, greater kudu and tsessebe. Elephant and hippo trudge through the swamps and leopard, and some nocturnal species, can be sighted as well. Birds abound, and the area is a birdwatcher’s paradise. Okavango ‘specials’ include the rare wattled crane, Pel’s Fishing owl, white backed nigh thereon and marsh owl. Great Plains Conservation is the only operator on the concession, offering guests the ultimate opportunity for private wildlife sightings.</p>
